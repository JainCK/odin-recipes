        <h4>Recipe instructions (taken from the book</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>First rinse 1.5 cups regular white rice in water a few times. Then soak the rice with 2 cups of water in a bowl for 4 to 5 hours. While soaking cover with a lid.</li>
            <li>Drain all the water and discard it. Add the drained,<br>
                 soaked rice to blender or grinder jar. Also add ½ cup grated fresh coconut, ¼ cup poha (flattened rice), ½ teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons sugar.</li>
            <li>Add ¾ cup water (or as needed) and blend or grind the ingredients to a smooth and fine flowing batter</li>
            <li>Mix ½ teaspoon dry active yeast first in 1 to 2 tablespoons of lukewarm water. Add this yeast solution to the batter and mix well.<br>
                 Cover and allow to ferment for 8 to 12 hours, depending on the temperature conditions. The batter will rise and double up the next day.</li>
            <li> A well-fermented batter will have many tiny air-pockets.</li>
            <li>Heat an appam pan or a seasoned kadai/wok with handles.<br>
                 Sprinkle about ½ teaspoon oil on the pan and spread it all over on the pan.<br>
                  If using nonstick kadai, then skip smearing the oil.</li>
            <li>The appam pan or appachatti works best as you get soft fluffy texture in the center and crisp texture towards the circumference.<br>
                 Spread a ladle full of the batter (about ¼ to ⅓ cup) into the hot pan.</li>
            <li>Turn and tilt the pan in circles so as to spread the batter into a round circle.

                Regulate the heat as needed.<br>
                 If the pan becomes too hot, the batter cooks faster and you wont be able to make a neat round batter with thin edges and a soft center</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with lid and let the appam cook for about 2 minutes or until the base becomes nicely light golden and the center firms up and becomes soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Remove and serve appam hot or warm. Repeat with remaining batter to make as may appam as you need.<br>
                 Store any remaining batter in the refrigerator and use within 1 day.</li>
            <li>Appam goes very well with vegetable stew and sweetened coconut milk. I like to serve them with both! It can also be served with veg korma or potato stew.</li>
